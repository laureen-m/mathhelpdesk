                          <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>

                          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">Everyone can learn math. A student’s success reflects not only their ability and their effort, but the ability and effort of their teacher. Unfortunately, even a small gap in one’s math education can grow into what feels like an insurmountable obstacle; but anyone who wants to understand - or even excel - is able to, with the right support.</p>
                          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">My primary goal in teaching is to help students learn how to learn, with a focus on understanding the material, instead of just memorizing it. I work hard to help translate the meaning behind the symbols so that students can tap into their own intuition, and ultimately become independent learners … and maybe even enjoy the experience along the way!</p>

          <h2>How I teach</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">Sessions are catered to each student, with the goal of helping them discover the material for themselves, instead of feeding them a meaningless algorithm for finding equally meaningless answers. Of course, answers are important; however, devoid of meaning and understanding, they will ultimately undermine a student's success both in- and outside of the classroom.</p><br>

        <div class="card card-body">
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">Much of the difficulty experienced by students of all levels and abilities turns around the language used to explain mathematical concepts. For mathematicians, precision to the point of pedantry is a virtue, not a flaw. In fact, math becomes a perfect training ground for basic reasoning skills thanks to this careful attention to detail, which allows for very subtle distinctions. However, a student exploring the material for the first time can be hampered by all the subtleties, if they are presented all at once, and is usually better served by starting with the obvious and gradually exploring each facet of the material, one at a time, until they can build up the more nuanced understanding of the topic, on their own.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">The core tenets of my approach to teaching are based on solid pedagogical research and include:
            <ul class="tenets" style="font-size: 20px; list-style: none;">
              <li>- fostering a growth mindset;</li>
              <li>- explaining the importance of mistakes, and how to learn from them;</li> 
              <li>- understanding that improvement comes at the point of optimal resistance;</li>
              <li>- regular, appropriate & diversified practice;</li>
              <li>- distinguishing between recognition and recall;</li>
              <li>- the advantage of complex conceptual relationships when it comes to recall;</li>
              <li>- the importance of narrative to successful retention;</li>
              <li>- using non-technical verbal communication as a measure of mastery;</li>
              <li>- scaffolding the exploration of new topics (setting students up for successful discovery);</li>
              <li>- learning to apply existing knowledge to new topics;</li>
            </ul>
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">amongst many others. These principles are woven into every session and can make all the difference to students, not only in math, but in any subject.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">I first started tutoring 18 years ago,  as a high school student helping foreign exchange students at the University of Winnipeg’s Collegiate. During my first year at McGill University’s MacDonald campus, I started offering group sessions to classmates who were struggling in math and physics. The success of these group sessions allowed me to complete three undergraduate degrees at McGill (B.Sc. in Agriculture, B.Sc. in Physics & B.A. in Religious Studies) and to develop a spaced-repetition app to help students learn Arabic vocabulary.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">After finishing my studies, I began teaching privately full-time, mostly for groups of 10-40 students, at the university level. In 2018 I started developing exam-prep courses for students at universities across Canada. and I am now the top-ranked instructor on Canada’s largest online tutoring platform.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">At the beginning of June 2020, I moved back to Winnipeg in order to launch a non-profit organization aimed at providing free access to top-quality math instruction for all students (pilot project to be launched Sept. 2021), as well as a concept-based spaced-repetition app for learning math. I am currently taking on a small number of private students in order to pay the bills, while working on this new project. Your support during this time will help our team to provide better math education to all Manitobans.</p>
